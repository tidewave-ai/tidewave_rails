  tool_name "edit_project_file"
  description <<~DESCRIPTION
    A tool for editing parts of a file. It can find and replace text inside a file.
    For moving or deleting files, use the shell_eval tool with 'mv' or 'rm' instead.

    For large edits, use the write_project_file tool instead and overwrite the entire file.

    Before editing, ensure to read the source file using the read_project_file tool.

    To use this tool, provide the path to the file, the old_string to search for, and the new_string to replace it with.
    If the old_string is found multiple times, an error will be returned. To ensure uniqueness, include a couple of lines
    before and after the edit. All whitespace must be preserved as in the original file.

    This tool can only do a single edit at a time. If you need to make multiple edits, you can create a message with
    multiple tool calls to this tool, ensuring that each one contains enough context to uniquely identify the edit.

    raise ArgumentError, "old_string is not unique" if scan_result.size > 1
