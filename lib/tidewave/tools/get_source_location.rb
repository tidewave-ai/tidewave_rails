class Tidewave::Tools::GetSourceLocation < Tidewave::Tools::Base
  tool_name "get_source_location"

  description <<~DESCRIPTION
    Returns the source location for the given reference.

    The reference may be a constant, most commonly classes and modules
    such as `String`, an instance method, such as `String#gsub`, or class
    method, such as `File.executable?`

    This works for methods in the current project, as well as dependencies.

    This tool only works if you know the specific constant/method being targeted.
    If that is the case, prefer this tool over grepping the file system.
