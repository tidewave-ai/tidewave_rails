This project implements Model Context Protocol tools
by embedding a MCP server inside a Rails application.
It uses Ruby's fast_mcp.

Once you are doing with changes, run `bundle exec rspec`
for tests and fix any failing test. Also run
`bin/rubocop --autocorrect` and fix any pending report
that has not been autocorrected.
