# Tidewave

Tidewave speeds up development with an AI assistant that understands your web application,
how it runs, and what it delivers. Our current release connects your editor's
assistant to your web framework runtime via [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

[See our website](https://tidewave.ai) for more information.

## Key Features

Tidewave provides tools that allow your LLM of choice to:

- inspect your application logs to help debugging errors
- execute SQL queries and inspect your database
- evaluate custom Ruby code in the context of your project
- find Rubygems packages and source code locations

and more.

## Installation

You can install Tidewave by adding the `tidewave` gem to the development group in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "tidewave", group: :development
```

Tidewave will now run on the same port as your regular Rails application.
In particular, the MCP is located by default at http://localhost:3000/tidewave/mcp.
[You must configure your editor and AI assistants accordingly](https://hexdocs.pm/tidewave/mcp.html).

## Configuration

You may configure the `tidewave` using the following syntax:

```ruby
  config.tidewave.allowed_ips = [IPAddr.new("192.168.97.1")]
```

The following options are available:

  * `:allowed_origins`

  * `:localhost_only`

  * `:allowed_ips`

You can read more about this options in [FastMCP](https://github.com/yjacquin/fast_mcp) README.

## Considerations

### Production Environment

Tidewave is a powerful tool that can help you develop your web application faster and more efficiently.
However, it is important to note that Tidewave is not meant to be used in a production environment.

Tidewave will raise an error if it is used in a production environment.

### Web server requirements

Tidewave currently requires a threaded web server like Puma.
